_A collection of personal &mdash; super-basic &mdash; utilities that I use for building SwiftUI applications._



## Installation

### Xcode Projects

Select `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency` and enter `https://github.com/CypherPoet/SwiftUIStarterKit`.


### Swift Package Manager Projects

You can add this project as a package dependency in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    //...
    dependencies: [
        .package(
            url: "https://github.com/CypherPoet/SwiftUIStarterKit", 
            .exact("0.0.55")
        ),
    ],
    //...
)
```

From there, refer to the `SwiftUIStarterKit` "product" delivered by the `CypherPoetSwiftUIStarterKit` "package" inside of any of your project's target dependencies:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourLibrary",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "SwiftUIStarterKit", package: "CypherPoetSwiftUIStarterKit"),
        ],
        ...
    ),
    ...
]
```

Then simply `import SwiftUIStarterKit` wherever you’d like to use it.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Currently, this project is mainly for personal use, and, as the commit history shows, is subject to fast and loose changes.

Nonetheless, several people have asked me to open-source it so they can use it as inspiration or as a starting point for their own utilities. That would be my recommended approach &mdash; though if you really want to be edgy and attempt direct usage, please at least pin it to an exact release tag, as shown in the installation instructions above.


## 💻 Developing

### Requirements

- Xcode 13.0+ (Recommended)


### 📜 Generating Documentation

### 📜 Generating Documentation

Documentation is generated by [Swift Doc](https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/swift-doc). Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/SwiftDocOrg/swift-doc#installation), and as soon as you have it set up, docs can be generated simply by running `./Scripts/generate-html-docs.zsh` from the command line.

📝 Note that this will only generate a `.build/documentation` folder for you to view locally. This folder is being ignored by `git`, and a GitHub [action](./.github/workflows/PublishDocumentation.yml) exists to automatically generate docs at the root level and serve them on the project's `gh-pages` branch.


## 🏷 License

`SwiftUIStarterKit` is available under the MIT license. See the [LICENSE file](./LICENSE) for more info.
